Machine learning practice assignment.

Data set: UCI Human Activity Recognition data set. Research team measured motion of subject humans and recorded signals to the data set.
Tasks: 
-use DBSCAN to cluster the data set, and interpret what the clusters represent.
-apply dimensionality reduction and see how it affects computational and clustering performance.
-use visualization on the way to show the process.
