Machine learning practice assignment.

Data set: UCI Human Activity Recognition data set. Research team measured motion of subject humans and recorded signals to the data set.
Tasks: 
-use DBSCAN to cluster the data set, and interpret what the clusters represent.
-apply dimensionality reduction and see how it affects computational and clustering performance.
-use visualization on the way to show the process.

Files needed to compile the project:
-MiniProject3 - Otto Westerlund.ipynb
-X_train.txt
-y_train.txt

Included is also a report on the process and findings, and other files that were included in the data set such as feature descriptions.
